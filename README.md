Ryan's dotfiles
===============

Installation
------------

Initial install:

```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/rgrove/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./bootstrap.sh
```

To update later:

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
git pull origin master
./bootstrap.sh
```

Warning
-------

I maintain this repo for my own use, so there are some things in here that are
specific to me (like my `.gitconfig`). You'll need to change things.


Thanks
------

Many thanks to [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles),
whose dotfiles I plundered (and continue to plunder) mercilessly.
